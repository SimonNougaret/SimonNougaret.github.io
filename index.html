        <h3>Neural underpinnings of social learning. How do we learn from observing others?  </h3>
        <p class="jst">
		In the complex world in which animals develop, besides learning from their own experience, they also learn socially. This ability allows them to understand the consequences of behaviors without direct experiences. An emblematic example of social learning involves the penguins from Antartica (Chamley 2004). They develop in large groups and live on the ice above the sea, which contains at the same time fishes, their main source of food, and killer whales. Aware of the danger, they wait and observe each other until one, too hungry, finally jumps. If no killer whale appears and the scout penguin exit the water safely, the other pinguins will instantantly follow. After observing the consequences of their conspecific’s action, they made their decision. 
		
		<br>
		My long-term scientific goal is to understand how our brain allows us to interact with the social world and use information from others to make our own decisions. In other terms, what are the neural underpinnings of social learning?
		<br>
			Social learning can be defined as the mecanisms allowing us to acquire skills and knowledge, being influenced by the obervation or interaction with other.

			I study the neural correlates of highly controlled behavior in non-human primates
			I first studied how subcortical structures 
            I study the electrophysiological properties of frontal and basal ganglia strutcures in macaques. 
			How does the brain integrate information about the subject's environment with internal processes like motivation to produce behavior? What are the neuronal mechanisms and circuits that implement those functions?
            <br> 
            To address those questions, XX.
